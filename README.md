## Description

Welcome to the Social Network API, a functional back-end application that posts user's thoughts, thought reactions, friend counts, and more! The routes within this application allow you to create, update, delete, and view all users and thoughts. Each user will track both assoicated friends and the length of the friend list. All thoughts will track the user reactions and the amount of reactions.

To create a full stack program, you will need to build a front-end that completes fetch requests using the routes designed in this application. Please contact me on GitHub if you need further assitance. 

## Visuals

This is a backend application, meaning that there are no visuals to share except a walkthrough video to show you what you can expect in your terminal to show that things are linked correctly.

## Installation

To enjoy this application, you will need to install Node JS on your local computer. [Click here for links to download Node JS.](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Then, clone this repository to your local computer, and open up the folder in your coding software (i.e. Visual Studio Code). Once open, open up your Terminal (on Mac OS) or GitBash (on Windows OS). You will have to direct yourself to the cloned repository, and then run this command in the terminal: 

`npm install`

This will download the node modules Express, Mongo, and Mongoose that this application needs to run on your local computer. After install, you will run the following command to start the server: 

`npm start` 

If the last message in the terminal says "App listening at http://localhost:####!", then you have installed the program correctly. If you ever need to shut down this server application use this command:

`^C`
